# 💪 IoT-Based Heath Monitoring System
## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, we developed an **IoT-based patient health monitoring system** using the ESP8266 & Arduino platforms:

- The IoT platform used in this project is called Thing Speak. Use the open-source Thing Speak Internet of items (IoT) application and API to save and get data from items using the **HTTP protocol** over the **Internet or over a Local Area Network**.
- This Internet of Things gadget could read the ambient temperature and heart rate. It updates them to an IoT platform while continuously checking the **temperature, Body Position, SPO2 and pulse rate**.  
- Real-time patient monitoring systems can incorporate the Internet of Things, a technology paradigm. The evaluation and application of real-time
The review and implementation of real-time patient monitoring systems utilizing **microcontrollers and biomedical sensors** are described. These systems measure physiological data including **heart rate, SPO2, triple Accelerometer, ECG and body temperature**.
- This Internet of Things prototype could read the body temperature and pulse rate, which could then update them on an IoT platform. 
- The patient's vital signs are continuously monitored by our system, which detects anomalies. Medical personnel receives the monitored data. The system notifies the medical professionals about any aberrant parameters as it encounters them. as a result, the requirement for manual monitoring by the medical staff is diminished.
Biomedical sensors, Arduino, the Internet of Things, and Thingspeak.
